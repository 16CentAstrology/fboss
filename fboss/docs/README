Document Versioning

We will use semantic versioning for all documents, as described below.

Major version:  Significant changes to a document which affect most if not all
                sections in the document.
Minor version:  Adding or removing entire sections, changes which significantly
                affect the interpretation of sections.
Patch version:  Minor corrections or fixes which affect the interpretation of
                the document in any way.
No change:      Typos or formatting fixes which do not affect the interpretation
                of any part of the document.
